## Main Features  

- üìÇ **Log file segmentation** ‚Äì Break down a full flight log into multiple files and structured tables.  
- üó∫ **GPS trajectory extraction** ‚Äì Generates GPS files from flight logs that represent the flight path of the drone.  
- üß© **Data conversion** ‚Äì Convert log data into CSV or TXT formats for detailed analysis.  
- üß† **Compatibility with Betaflight, EmuFlight and INAV logs.**  
- üíæ **Exportable data** ‚Äì Save and share log segments and GPS tracks with colleagues.  
- üîç **Support for large log files** ‚Äì Efficient handling of full-length flights and high-frequency data.
